This is the readme file for data.

The original source of these climate data are here:https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/historical/daily-data.html?sid=217107&sname=ROSEMOUNT%20RESEARCH%20AND%20OUTREACH%20CENTER&sdate=por&edate=por

The climate data were downloaded and then cleaned up before being stored on the SCS shared drive here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVGE8zRiSo8F9ao63nYfM1QSkBhw_x8UvshLbR_LPIs/edit?gid=1243942064#gid=1243942064

I downloaded this drive file as a .csv, which is what you'll find in this data folder.
